They go into a hospital in New New York, where Rose meets the villain Cassandra (ZoÃ« Wanamaker) again. Cassandra possesses Rose's body as she is in need of one, but the Doctor is suspicious of Rose's actions. They discover that the hospital holds hundreds of artificially-grown humans that have been infected with diseases so the Sisters of Plenitude can find their cures. Rose releases several of the humans as a distraction, but they release others and a zombie-like attack begins. The Doctor sprays the infected humans with the solution from a disinfectant shower, curing them. The Doctor orders Cassandra out of Rose and she transfers her consciousness to her servant Chip (Sean Gallagher), but his cloned body fails and Cassandra accepts her death.")

Unknown to them, the estate has been captured by a group of monks who have brought a werewolf in hopes to infect Queen Victoria. The Doctor notices the trap and tries to shield himself, Victoria, and Rose from the werewolf. He learns that the estate was designed as a trap for the werewolf as it contains a large telescope which, with Victoria's Koh-i-Noor diamond and full moonlight, can force the werewolf into a human form. Though they save her, Queen Victoria is appalled by the Doctor and Rose's modern eccentricities and founds Torchwood Institute to defend Britain from further alien attacks.")

Rose, working as a dinner lady, notices the cafeteria's chips have an adverse effect on other members of the kitchen staff, while the Doctor notes the chips seem to make the students more intelligent. The success of headmaster Mr Finch (Anthony Head) has aroused media attention; investigative journalist and the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) arrives at the school and discovers the TARDIS one night. She and her robotic dog K-9 join up with the Doctor, Rose, and Mickey and they discover that the teachers are actually Krillitanes and the chips are coated with Krillitane oil, intended to make the children smart enough so they can decode the 'Skasis Paradigm', a theory of everything, which will give the Krillitanes full control of time and space. The Doctor refuses to join the Krillitanes and evacuates the children of the school, after which K-9 detonates the container of the chip oil which destroys the Krillitanes, the school, and K-9. Sarah Jane declines the Doctor's offer to travel with him and suggests that Mickey do so instead, and the Doctor gives her a brand new model of K-9.")
